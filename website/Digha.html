                Digha is the most popular sea beach in West Bengal. It is located 187 km south-west of Kolkata. Digha
                has a low gradient with shallow sand beach that extends up to 7 km in length and has gentle rolling
                waves. The scenic beauty of this place is charming and alluring. Apart from beautification casuarinas
                plantations also help
                in reducing erosion of the dunes.
                Digha originally known as "Beerkul" during the time of Warren Hastings, was discovered in the late 18th
                century by the British. It was mentioned as the "Brighton of the East" in one of the letters of Warren
                Hastings (1780 AD) to his wife. After independence, Frank Smith convinced
                chief minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy to develop Digha as a beach resort.
