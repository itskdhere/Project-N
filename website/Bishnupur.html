                Bishnupur is a town in the Bankura District of West Bengal and located at about 132 km from Kolkata. It
                is famous for its terracotta temples and Baluchari sarees. The town has a glorious past that is
                reflected in its rich architecture, music and handicrafts such as pottery and weaving. It prospered in
                the 17th and early 18th centuries. Ruled by a line of Hindu Rajas of the Malla dynasty, Bishnupur
                developed a unique form of architecture and has perhaps the most brilliant and detailed terracotta work
                in Eastern India that has withstood the ravages of time. The Terracotta tiles depict stories from
                Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Temples like the Shyam Ray Temple, the twin shrines of Jorbangla and the
                Rasmancha are a must visit. Apart from its heritage, Bishnupur is also known for its traditional
                handloom sarees. Pottery, artifacts and even jewellery made of terracotta in Bishnupur are also very
                popular. Bishnupur is also famous for the School of Hindustani Music which flourished under royal
                patronage along with the Bishnupur School of Painting. This style of music is still being kept alive in
                local academies of music. The history of Bishnupur can be traced back to 694 AD, when King Raghunath
                founded the Malla dynasty. However, it was much later in 994 AD that the place was named Bishnupur. The
                name is derived from the name of the Hindu God Vishnu. The most powerful king of the dynasty was King
                Raghunath Singh Dev II, who ruled from 1626 AD. At that time the administration of Bengal was in the
                hands of Shah Jahan and his son Shuja. He developed a close friendship with the king and there followed
                a period of peace when art and music already flourishing, reached great heights. It was during this
                period that the Jorbangla Temple was erected.
